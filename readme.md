# Qdrant Embedding Search

This project demonstrates how to use Qdrant as a vector database to store and query document embeddings generated by a machine learning model.

## Features
- Generate embeddings for text documents.
- Store embeddings in a Qdrant collection.
- Query the collection to find similar documents based on vector similarity.

## Requirements
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Qdrant server running locally or remotely
- `dotenv` for environment variable management
- `fastembed` for generating text embeddings

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RGGH/rig-qdr
    cd rig-qdr
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

3. Set up your `.env` file with the necessary environment variables for the OpenAI API key:
    ```plaintext
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
    ```

4. Run Qdrant locally:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
    ```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
cargo run
```

The program:
- Loads a set of sample documents.
- Generates embeddings using the `fastembed` model.
- Creates a Qdrant collection (if it doesn't exist).
- Inserts the generated embeddings into the collection.
- Queries the collection with a sample query vector.

## Querying

You can modify the query vector to search for documents similar to a given text by updating the `query_vector` in the code.
